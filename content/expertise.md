<h2>Mathematical Modeling</h2>
<p>
    Mathematical modeling is a valuable tool to use when
    tackling problems that have plagued industries for
    years. It's especially beneficial for complex and
    high-risk New Product Development projects. After all,
    what we learn from mathematical simulations enables
    us to mitigate as much risk as possible before the
    design and building process even begins. Our
    capabilities include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>COMSOL Multiphysics Modules</li>
    <li>AC/DC Module</li>
    <li>Heat Transfer Module</li>
    <li>Structural Mechanics Module</li>
    <li>CFD Module</li>
    <li>Mixer Module</li>
    <li>Optimization Library</li>
    <li>Material Library</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sensors and IoT</h2>
<p>
    In our state-of-the-art research and development
    lab, it's possible to design, prototype, and evaluate
    concepts that enable devices and machines to
    communicate over the internet. We have the
    engineering and technological know-how to design
    sensors, gather and clean data, and develop the
    communication layers and user interface to create
    an loT product from scratch.
