## Yeah, we've
# Got know-how
<br/>

Truly breakthrough product development
requires high quality engineering capabilities and
services. As a knowledge-based company, we
use a stage-gate approach that involves constant
testing, refinement, and communication.

At PCDworks, we have the team, technology, and
tenacity to take on even the most impossible
engineering challenges.

## Mechanical Engineering
<br/>

With extensive engineering capabilities, we provide a
full range of services, including 3D CAD layouts,
electronic circuit design, analytical modeling, and
multi-physics simulation. Our mechanical engineering
team is dedicated to quickly producing strong designs
and performing engineering calculations to verify your
conceptâ€™s validity. Capabilities include:

* Analytical Modeling
* Solid Modeling
* Multi-physics FEA (Heat transfer, stress/strain, vibration and fatigue, CFD)
* Design for Manufacturing
* Computational Fluid Dynamic Modeling

## Mathematical Modeling
<br/>

Mathematical modeling is a valuable tool to use when
tackling problems that have plagued industries for
years. It's especially beneficial for complex and
high-risk New Product Development projects. After all,
what we learn from mathematical simulations enables
us to mitigate as much risk as possible before the
design and building process even begins. Our
capabilities include:

* COMSOL Multiphysics Modules
* AC/DC Module
* Heat Transfer Module
* Structural Mechanics Module
* CFD Module
* Mixer Module
* Optimization Library
* Material Library

## Sensors and IoT
<br/>

In our state-of-the-art research and development
lab, it's possible to design, prototype, and evaluate
concepts that enable devices and machines to
communicate over the internet. We have the
engineering and technological know-how to design
sensors, gather and clean data, and develop the
communication layers and user interface to create
an loT product from scratch.
