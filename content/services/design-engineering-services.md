## We turn big ideas into the next big thing through  "KNOWING"

At PCDworks we realize that innovation isn't
just about having great ideas. It's about reducing risk, proving concepts 
and executing them. Reducing risk is about gaining **knowledge**, about gaining **certainty**. 
This means knowing enough from each step of the process to go onto the next step. This is 
what the Toyota's Knowledge Based System is all about, as detailed by
<a href="/the-knowledge-creating-company.pdf" target="_blank">Nonaka in 1991.</a>
We have been followers of Nonaka's Knowledge-Creating company from the start. 

To guide you at this crucial stage, we employ a winning approach to product
development, which is *iterative, multi-step and knowledge based*. This includes 
gaining knowledge through research, conceptualization, feasibility assessment, 
establishing design requirements, preliminary design, testing,  detailed design, 
prototyping the final design, prototype-to-production planning, production, and finally testing again. 

No doubt, the best way to test a theory is to see it in action. That's why we're
committed to getting physical fast and extensive testing to validation.

## Experience the fast and
# The curious

With a fully outfitted prototype lab just steps away from our brainstorming
facilities, and an extraordinary team of curious-minded product design
experts, we can help you design and build just about anything you can dream up.
We also offer a wide suite of digital tools to proof and test designs,
including finite element analysis (FEA), multi-physics analysis, and
analytical and mathematical modeling.

So, whether you need a look-alike model, a test apparatus, or a fully
functional design, we can help you go from ideation to functioning prototype
in record time.
