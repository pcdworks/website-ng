<h2>To reach startup success,</h2>
<h1>Start here</h1>
<p>
    A basecamp is a strategic spot on a mountain
    that gives the bold souls daring to reach the
    summit a place to prepare themselves and their
    gear for the journey. The basecamp doesn't get
    climbers to the top of the mountain, but instead
    prepares them for the trials ahead, de-risking the
    venture to ensure success.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You'll find our HardTech Basecamp functions in much the same way.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Here, you and your team will live on an 80-acre campus in the quiet hills of
    the Piney Woods Region of East Texas, free from distraction. You'll work on
    your project in an equipment-rich environment with PCDworks innovation
    mentors, engineers, and tradesmen. Each one available 24/7 to help you
    design and build your “hard” physical innovation. Every day, you'll learn, fail
    fast, and push forward while avoiding pitfalls.
</p>
<p>
    There's more. You'll dwell in a comfortable guest house on our beautiful
    campus where you'll live and eat with the founders and other entrepreneurs
    as family to foster team building and nurture creative problem-solving. The
    entire experience is designed to focus the spirit of creativity and
    camaraderie and accelerate your project to the next stage.

<h2>We strive to make</h2>
<h1>Campers happy</h1>
<p>
    HardTech Basecamp teams with PCDworks where our engineers work every
    day in the product development business. You'll have access to these
    professionals as well as to our facilities. This includes a machine shop
    workspace, office space to continue to work on the “paperwork” part of your
    project, and conference rooms for team meetings.
</p>
<p>
    You also have access to our engineering and office software, 3D printing,
    prototyping equipment, and testing hardware, which saves you precious
    capital. There's even a gym and a game room to go along with 8 guest
    rooms with private bathrooms and queen size beds. In short, we have
    everything you need to be a happy—and highly productive—camper.

<h2>Here's what separates us from</h2>
<h1>The pack</h1>
<p>
    Most incubators or accelerators provide office space and mentoring that
    target early business development challenges. Things like market analysis,
    financial modeling, pitch development, and business model refinement.
</p>

<p>
    But, to maximize valuation, your startup must also make significant strides
    in developing its technology. HardTech Basecamp enables you to move
    quickly through technology readiness levels, develop robust solutions, and
    use capital efficiently.
</p>

<p>
    How? With our expertise in electrical, mechanical, and software engineering;
    as well material science and mathematical and multi-physics modeling.
    With our ability to conduct testing and certification up to (1A), Intrinsically
    Safe UL levels. And with our Design for Manufacturing (DFM) experience
    and manufacturing and sourcing connections in China, Romania, Germany,
    and the US.
</p>

<p>
    Once your initial prototype is built and tested, tap into our 25 years of
    commercialization experience to help with what Thomas Edison called the
    “99% Perspiration” part of innovation, which is bringing your product into the
    marketplace.
</p>
<p>
    This broad set of capabilities, coupled with our diverse a skill set, is what
    allows us to help you get your product to market fast.
