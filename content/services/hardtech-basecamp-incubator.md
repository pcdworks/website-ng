## To reach startup success,
# Start here

A basecamp is a strategic spot on a mountain
that gives the bold souls daring to reach the
summit a place to prepare themselves and their
gear for the journey. The basecamp doesn't get
climbers to the top of the mountain, but instead
prepares them for the trials ahead, de-risking the
venture to ensure success. Just ask the [founders of Renewell.](https://www.renewellenergy.com/)

**You'll find our HardTech Basecamp functions in much the same way.**

Here, you and your team will live on an 80-acre campus in the quiet hills of
the Piney Woods Region of East Texas, free from distraction. You'll work on
your project in an equipment-rich environment with PCDworks innovation
mentors, engineers, and tradesmen. Each one available 24/7 to help you
design and build your “hard” physical innovation. Every day, you'll learn, fail
fast, and push forward while avoiding pitfalls.

There's more. You'll dwell in a comfortable guest house on our beautiful
campus where you'll live and eat with the founders and other entrepreneurs
as family to foster team building and nurture creative problem-solving. The
entire experience is designed to focus the spirit of creativity and
camaraderie and accelerate your project to the next stage.

## We strive to make
# Campers happy

HardTech Basecamp teams with PCDworks where our engineers work every
day in the product development business. You'll have access to these
professionals as well as to our facilities. This includes a machine shop
workspace, office space to continue to work on the “paperwork” part of your
project, and conference rooms for team meetings.

You also have access to our engineering and office software, our video studio, 3D printing,
prototyping equipment, and testing hardware, which can save you precious time and
capital. There's even a gym and a game room to go along with 8 guest
rooms with private bathrooms and queen size beds. In short, we have
everything you need to be a happy—and highly productive—camper.

## Here's what separates us from
# The pack

Most incubators or accelerators provide office space and mentoring that
target early business development challenges. Things like market analysis,
financial modeling, pitch development, and business model refinement.

But, to maximize valuation, your startup must also make significant strides
in developing your technology. HardTech Basecamp enables you to move
quickly through technology readiness levels, develop robust solutions, and
use capital efficiently.

How? With our expertise in electrical, mechanical, and software engineering;
as well as material science and mathematical and multi-physics modeling.
With our ability to conduct testing and certification up to (1A), Intrinsically
Safe UL levels. And with our Design for Manufacturing (DFM) experience
and manufacturing and sourcing connections in China, Romania, Germany,
and the US.

Once your initial prototype is built and tested, tap into our 25 years of
commercialization experience to help with what Thomas Edison called the
“99% Perspiration” part of innovation, which is bringing your product into the
marketplace.

This broad set of capabilities, coupled with our diverse a skill set, is what
allows us to help you get your product to market fast.

## Is HardTech Basecamp
# RIGHT FOR YOU?

**Chances are we're a good fit, if:**

* Your idea or product is a physical “hardtech” product
* Your idea has been externally vetted (Accelerator, Award based competition, Awarded a Grant, Other Incubator, Entrepreneurial Program)
* Your group has a vetted idea but needs help designing or building the prototype
* You're passionate and motivated about innovation and technology
* You're willing to put skin in the game, meaning you're able to come with some initial
funding which may be augmented by our investors, depending on where you are in your
development process and the strength of your “pitch”
