## We help discover
# Exceptional ideas

We don’t stumble onto great ideas. We clear a path
and welcome them in through the Immersive
Innovation™ process developed by PCDworks
founder, psychologist Mike Rainone.

Immersive Innovation serves as a catalyst to expand the solution space beyond
the current thinking. Through it, you gain new insight into your own
understanding of the problem-the “aha” moment.

All told, our Immersive Innovation process allows your team to define and
decompose its problem, abandon preconceived notions, identify the solution
space, and develop new and innovative concepts within this solution space. This
all takes place at the PCDworks campus, where you're surrounded by the right
people, the right psychology, and the right tools and technology to quickly move
ideas to build out concepts. And most importantly, it's the perfect location for
distraction-free collaboration and breakthrough thinking.

## Experience te power of
# many

Sometimes it's who you know in the world of innovation. And we know a
lot of people.

Over the past 25 years, we've built a trusted and diverse network of
technology and business experts from around the globe to provide the
most innovative thinking.

We don't shop our problems around to large crowd-sourced platforms.
After all, we work in some of the most highly proprietary environments,
and we understand the need for discretion and protection. By the same
token, we're not afraid to reach out and find the missing expertise if we
don't have it in-house (which doesn't happen often).

By bringing together a diverse multidisciplinary team, old ideas are
buried, new insights are identified and developed, and breakthrough
innovation occurs.
